A leaked video has caused widespread concern and outrage among the public. The video appears to show military leaders discussing plans to weaponize artificial intelligence against the general population. High-ranking officials are depicted discussing the deployment of intelligent weapons systems in response to civil unrest and other perceived threats to national security.

The authenticity of the video has not been independently verified and military authorities have yet to comment. Human rights organizations are calling for an immediate investigation and a halt to any further development of AI and psycological weapons. The leaked video raises serious questions about the ethics of using advanced technology to control and subdue civilian populations and sparks a heated debate about the role of artificial intelligence in modern warfare.
